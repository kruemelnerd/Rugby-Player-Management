UserStories:

- [ ] As a Player I want to sign up to my Rugbyclub and fill out the needed informations, so that I can play on the next matchday.
- [ ] As a Player I want to log in to see, how far the process of my application is already, so that I know if it's possible to play on the next matchday.
- [ ] As a Player I want to recive a filled out application form after the process, so that I don't have to fill out any form by hand.

- [ ] As a Caretaker (Coach, Chairman, ...) I want to log in and see all player, who have or don't have a playerspass application, so I don't need to ask the groundsman about the application.

- [ ] As a groundsman I want all information packed up and send to involved persons, so that they get informed about the next steps.

- [ ] As a financier I want automatically information when there is the need to transfer money for new players, so that I don't need to wait for the groundsman.
- [ ] As a financier I want an easy upload solution, to store my screenshot of the transfer, so that I don't need to worry about.
